# The basic of Python

Hi, I'm Morteza Rahimi, a Python developer
At first install python, to install it visit 
[Python Website](https://www.python.org/)

This repo is about very basic things like variables, condition and etc.
It's good and  necessary to visit 
[Python Doc](https://www.python.org/doc/) for more informations

When you see "#" that means everythin after that is comment and it doesn't run
Also everything between <'''  '''>, <"""  """> is comment
